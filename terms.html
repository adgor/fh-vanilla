                LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
                AND THAT THE OPERATORS WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE WEBSITE ABSENT SUCH

                The Website is hosted in the United States. The Operators make
                no claims that the Content on the Website is appropriate or may
                be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the
                Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain
                countries. If you access the Website from outside the United
                States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for
                compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The provisions of
                the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
                Goods will not apply to these Terms. A party may give notice to
                the other party only in writing at that party's principal place
                of business, attention of that party's principal legal officer,
                or at such other address or by such other method as the party
                shall specify in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon
                personal delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail
                with postage prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing,
                or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage
                prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing. If any
                provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining
                provisions will continue in full force without being affected in
                any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such
                unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most
                closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the
                unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference
                purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or describe the
                scope or extent of such section. The failure of the Operators to
                act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others
                does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit the Operators'
                rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
                Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this
                Agreement or User's use of the Website must be brought in the
                courts of Belgium, and you consent to the exclusive personal
                jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you
                may have with respect to your use of the Website must be
                commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action
                arises. These Terms set forth the entire understanding and
                agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or
                written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to
                their subject matter. The waiver of a breach of any provision of
                this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
                or subsequent breach.

              <h2 id="10linkstoothermaterials">10. Links to Other Materials</h2>

              <p>
                The Website may contain links to sites owned or operated by
                independent third parties. These links are provided for your
                convenience and reference only. We do not control such sites
                and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on
                these sites. The fact that the Operators offer such links should
                not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or
                sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or
                products referenced therein, and the Operators reserve the right
                to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement on
                the Website. If you decide to access any of the third party
                sites linked to by the Website, you do this entirely at your own
                risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or
                otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be
                deemed inappropriate or offensive, the Operators cannot be held
                responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or
                decency of material contained in third party sites, and you
                hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to
                such sites.
