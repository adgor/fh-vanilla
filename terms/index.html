                      Our Transfers Team will make every effort to help you move
                      your website to us. Transfers are provided as a courtesy
                      service. We do not make any guarantees regarding the
                      availability, possibility, or time required to complete an
                      account transfer. Each hosting company is configured
                      differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an
                      incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it
                      extremely difficult, if not impossible, to migrate some or
                      all account data. In some cases we may not be able to
                      assist you in a transfer of data from an old host. The
                      free transfer service is available for thirty (30) days
                      from your sign up date. Transfers outside of the thirty
                      (30) day period will incur a charge; please contact a
                      member of our Transfers department to receive a price
                      quote. In no event shall HostGator be held liable for any
                      lost or missing data or files resulting from a transfer to
                      or from HostGator. You are solely responsible for backing
                      up your data in all circumstances.

                              can have an adverse effect on server performance.
                              Similarly, accounts with an excessive number of
                              database tables (in excess of 5000 database
                              tables) or an excessive database size (in excess
                              of 10GB total database usage or 5GB database usage
                              in a single database) negatively affect the

                              exceed these amounts, HostGator may request that
                              you reduce the number of files/inodes, database
                              tables, or total databases to ensure optimal

                      If your shared or reseller server has a physical downtime
                      that falls short of the 99.9% uptime guarantee, you may
                      receive one (1) month of credit on your account. This
                      uptime guarantee does not apply to planned maintenance.
                      Approval of any credit is at the sole discretion of
                      HostGator and may be dependent upon the justification
                      provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not
                      be used for justification due to a variety of factors
                      including the monitor's network capacity/transit
                      availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the
                      reported uptime from the operating system and the Apache
                      Web Server which may differ from the uptime reported by
                      other individual services. To request a credit, please
                      contact our Billing department by calling 1-866-964-2867

                      Dedicated servers are covered by a network guarantee in

                      By using the Services, you hereby submit to the exclusive
                      jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association
                      ("AAA") in connection with any dispute relating to,
                      concerning or arising out of this Agreement. The
                      arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator
                      chosen by HostGator and will be held at the AAA location
                      chosen by HostGator in Texas. Payment of all filing,
                      administrative and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
                      AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph. In
                      the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
                      arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs
                      of litigation, HostGator will pay as much of your filing,
                      administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the
                      arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent
                      the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The
                      arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an
                      individual basis without the right for any claims to be
                      arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving
                      claims brought in a purported representative capacity on
                      behalf of others. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any
                      state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this
                      paragraph. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will
                      be binding and final. The arbitrator's award is final and
                      binding on all parties. The arbitrator's authority to
                      resolve and make written awards is limited to claims
                      between you and HostGator alone. Claims may not be joined
                      or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all
                      parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any
                      preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute
                      with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.
                      If you initiate litigation or any other proceeding against
                      HostGator in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay
                      HostGator's reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred
                      in connection with our enforcement of this paragraph.

                prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing. If any
                provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining
                provisions will continue in full force without being affected in
                any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such
                unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most
                closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the
                unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference
                purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or describe the
                scope or extent of such section. The failure of the Operators to
                act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others
                does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit the Operators'
                rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
                Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this
                Agreement or User's use of the Website must be brought in the
                courts of Belgium, and you consent to the exclusive personal
                jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you
                may have with respect to your use of the Website must be
                commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action
                arises. These Terms set forth the entire understanding and
                agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or
                written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to
                their subject matter. The waiver of a breach of any provision of
                this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
                or subsequent breach.

              <p>
                The Website may contain links to sites owned or operated by
                independent third parties. These links are provided for your
                convenience and reference only. We do not control such sites
                and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on
                these sites. The fact that the Operators offer such links should
                not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or
                sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or
                products referenced therein, and the Operators reserve the right
                to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement on
                the Website. If you decide to access any of the third party
                sites linked to by the Website, you do this entirely at your own
                risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or
                otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be
                deemed inappropriate or offensive, the Operators cannot be held
                responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or
                decency of material contained in third party sites, and you
                hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to
                such sites.
