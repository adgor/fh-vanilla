                          monetization, if an Order has expired, or is

                      The Registrant agrees that, if the use of the Order is
                      challenged by a third party, the Registrant will be
                      subject to the provisions of the appropriate Dispute
                      policy for that Order as mentioned in the appropriate
                      Appendix in effect at the time of the dispute. The
                      Registrant agrees that in the event a dispute arises with
                      any third party, the Registrant will indemnify and hold
                      Registrar, Registry Operator and Service Providers

                      with a judicial or administrative body regarding the
                      Registrant's use of the Order, the Registrant agrees not
                      to make any changes to the Order without Registrar's prior
                      approval. Registrar may not allow the Registrant to make
                      changes to such Order until:

                          regarding the expiry of any Order. As a convenience to

                          term of an Order, Registrant has no rights on such
                          Order, or any information associated with such Order,
                          and that ownership of such Order now passes on to the
                          Registrar. Registrar and Service Providers may make
                          any modifications to said Order or any information
                          associated with said Order. Registrar and Service
                          Providers may intercept any network/communication

                          in their sole discretion. Registrar and Service
                          Providers may choose to monetize such requests in any
                          fashion at their sole discretion. Registrar and
                          Service Providers may choose to display any
                          appropriate message, and/or send any response to any

                          sole discretion. Such renewal after the expiry of the
                          Order may not result in exact reinstatement of the
                          Order in the same form as it was prior to expiry.

                      registered marks to exclusively pre-register on the .NAME

                      trademarks. A "Defensive Registration" is a registration
                      granted to a third party of a specific string on the
                      second or third level, or of a specific set of strings on
                      the second and third levels, which will not resolve within
                      the domain name system but may prevent the registration of
                      the same string(s) on the same level(s) by other third
                      party applicants.

                The Website is hosted in the United States. The Operators make
                no claims that the Content on the Website is appropriate or may
                be downloaded outside of the United States. Access to the
                Content may not be legal by certain persons or in certain
                countries. If you access the Website from outside the United
                States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for
                compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. The provisions of
                the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
                Goods will not apply to these Terms. A party may give notice to
                the other party only in writing at that party's principal place
                of business, attention of that party's principal legal officer,
                or at such other address or by such other method as the party
                shall specify in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon
                personal delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail
                with postage prepaid, 5 business days after the date of mailing,
                or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage
                prepaid, 7 business days after the date of mailing. If any
                provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining
                provisions will continue in full force without being affected in
                any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such
                unenforceable provision with an enforceable provision that most
                closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the
                unenforceable provision. Section headings are for reference
                purposes only and do not define, limit, construe or describe the

                act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others
                does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit the Operators'
                rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
                Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this
                Agreement or User's use of the Website must be brought in the
                courts of Belgium, and you consent to the exclusive personal
                jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you
                may have with respect to your use of the Website must be
                commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action
                arises. These Terms set forth the entire understanding and
                agreement of the parties, and supersedes any and all oral or
                written agreements or understandings between the parties, as to
                their subject matter. The waiver of a breach of any provision of
                this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
                or subsequent breach.

                and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on

                not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or

                to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement on
                the Website. If you decide to access any of the third party
                sites linked to by the Website, you do this entirely at your own
                risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or

                deemed inappropriate or offensive, the Operators cannot be held
                responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or
                decency of material contained in third party sites, and you
                hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to
                such sites.
